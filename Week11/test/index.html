<!-- 
  Quiz 8:
  
  Recreate the "SignUp Form" of a well-known company (preferably in tech), without
  peeking into their code. There are a number of considerations here, so please
  continue reading the instructions carefully to avoid any mistakes. Here, we ask you
  to recreate the form, so your page won't have to look exactly like the original
  page, but you intend to have the same fields.

  The form needs at least 5 fields with at least 3 different input types (like passwords, dates, text, email, numbers, etc.)

  Add a link to the original page with the text "Original Page".

  You CANNOT copy ANY code (HTML, CSS, or Javascript) from any sources! All of the submitted code should
  be written by you.

  You will assessed based on the quality of the form (proper placeholder, type, autocomplete, etc.).
